  - The `id` column on the `Comment` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - The primary key for the `Notification` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
  - The `id` column on the `Notification` table would be dropped and recreated. This will lead to data loss if there is data in the column.
  - The primary key for the `Post` table will be changed. If it partially fails, the table could be left without primary key constraint.
